        text: "Hey there, this is Alvin. I am a student studying Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo, Canada. I am particularly interested in developing software or embedded applications, and I have had professional experiences as a software developer in various positions. It is also my personal hobby to dabble in communication and social platforms like facebook and snapchat, and some of the applications I have created are listed above. I have learnt to work in a fast paced environment by being flexible and adaptive. Outside of work, I love sports like basketball, badminton, and ice hockey. I also love going to different hackathons to build cool stuff.",
